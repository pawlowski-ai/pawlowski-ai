## 🧠 About me

I'm a hands-on AI practitioner working at the intersection of prompt engineering, LLM evaluation, and AI product integration. I combine real-world prompt QA expertise with solo product building – from concept to shipped tools.

Over the past year, I’ve:
- ✍️ Delivered 400+ feedback reports as a QA Specialist on RLHF/SFT pipelines at [Invisible Technologies](https://www.invisible.co/)
- 🧱 Built and launched [Memorio](https://memorio-pamiec.netlify.app/), an AI-powered photo restoration + memorial builder using GPT-4o agents
- 🧠 Created [DreamAI](https://tinyurl.com/jungAI) – an experimental AI powered web app for Jungian dream interpretation with safety filters & red teaming
- 📚 Started [Mózgowiec Digest](https://mozgowiec.substack.com/), a weekly blog and newsletter blending AI, neuroscience and self-optimization
