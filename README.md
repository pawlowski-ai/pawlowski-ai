## 🧠 About me

I'm an AI builder working at the intersection of **LLM prompt design, safety testing, and lightweight AI product engineering**. I specialize in **evaluating and integrating foundation models** – building pipelines, guardrails, and tools that make them more usable, safer, and aligned with human needs.

I started in SFT/RLHF pipelines as a **AI Trainer and QA Specialist** and have since expanded into **prompt taxonomy design, adversarial testing, real-time evaluation tooling (Colab + Hugging Face), and LLM-integrated frontend apps.**

## 🧰 What I’ve built

### 🔎 [`PROMPT_GALLERY`](https://github.com/pawlowski-ai/PROMPT_GALLERY)
> A structured, red-team-oriented collection of LLM prompts (hallucinations, jailbreaks, few-shot, etc.), tested live against Hugging Face models.

Includes a self-contained evaluation notebook built with `transformers`, `AutoTokenizer`, GPU acceleration and model inference.

### 🧠 [`JungAI`](https://github.com/pawlowski-ai/JungAI)
> A Vite + React app with Gemini integration. Features a fully custom system prompt wrapper designed for content filtering, refusal logic, and archetypal reasoning (Jungian psychology). Includes strict red-teaming logic and abuse prevention. Deployed live. 

### 🕊 [`Memorio`](https://github.com/pawlowski-ai/memorio)
> A handcrafted AI-powered photo restoration + memorial site. Built from scratch with HTML/CSS/JS and AI-generated assets. Integrated Stripe for payments and Netlify Forms for frictionless UX. Deployed live.
